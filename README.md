# Diabetes



**International Diabetes Federation** refers that **463 million** people living with diabetes. There are couple of questions coming up to my mind. First of all how serious is this disease? What symptoms should pay my attention? Finally, the most important question -  what is the probability that I can suffer from diabetes? 

I decided to do some research on this and present key figures which I found on International Diabetes Federation site:

To answer to those questions we should explain what diabetes is. The situation when the **pancreas** is no longer able to make **insulin** leads to **chronic disease which is called diabetes**. 

There is another question what is the insulin and why it is so important for us? We know that to do some stuff we need energy, which is produce by our cells. How does it work? The cells need our help, they need some ‘fuel’. Ok, so let’s do this, we can eat some glucose-rich food. What is next? How our cells absorb it from food which we ate? This is the role for insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, letting glucose from the food we eat pass from the bloodstream into the cells in the body. If we are not able to produce insulin, the glucose levels in the blood raised leading to hyperglycaemia. In the long term high glucose levels can lead to irreparable damage to our body. 


There are three types of diabetes:
- **Type 1** - body produces very little or no insulin, occurs most frequently in children and adolescents
- **Type 2** - body does not make good use of the insulin that it produces, more common in adults
- **Gestational diabetes (GDM)** - consists of high blood glucose during pregnancy and is associated with complications to both mother and child.


Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are:
- Increased thirst.
- Frequent urination.
- Extreme hunger.
- Unexplained weight loss.
- Presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough      available insulin)
- Fatigue.
- Irritability.

To answer the last question and calculate  the probability that I can suffer from diabetes, I decided to use Machine Learning to help me predict Diabetes. 


**The goal of the project** is to choose the ML model with the best accuracy in predicting diabetes disease and use it in user application which help people decide if they are in risk group.
